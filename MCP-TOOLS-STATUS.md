## MCP Tools Installation Notes

### Successfully Installable MCP Tools:

1. **Desktop Commander** ✅
   ```bash
   npm install -g @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
   ```

2. **Memory Server** ⚠️ (Community version)
   ```bash
   npm install -g mcp-memory-server
   ```

### Currently Unavailable on NPM:

These MCP servers are mentioned in documentation but not yet published to npm:

- **@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite** - SQLite server (in development)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/server-github** - GitHub integration (in development)  
- **@modelcontextprotocol/server-reddit** - Reddit integration (in development)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer** - Puppeteer browser automation (in development)

### Alternative Solutions:

1. **For SQLite**: Use the TypeScript SDK to build your own
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server sqlite-server
   ```

2. **For GitHub**: Use the GitHub CLI instead
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```

3. **Manual Installation from GitHub**:
   Some servers might be available as GitHub repos:
   ```bash
   # Example (if repo exists):
   git clone https://github.com/username/mcp-server-sqlite
   cd mcp-server-sqlite
   npm install
   npm link
   ```

### Why Installation Failed:

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) is very new (announced recently by Anthropic), and many of the servers are still being developed. The packages that failed to install simply don't exist on npm yet.

### What You CAN Use Right Now:

1. **Desktop Commander** - Full computer control
   ```bash
   npm install -g @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander
   ```
   Then add to Claude config:
   ```json
   {
     "desktop-commander": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Custom MCP Servers** - Build your own
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-typescript-server my-server
   ```

### Current State of MCP Ecosystem:

- **SDK**: ✅ Available (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
- **Inspector**: ✅ Available (`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`)
- **Server Template**: ✅ Available (`create-typescript-server`)
- **Pre-built Servers**: ⚠️ Most still in development

The MCP protocol is brand new, so the ecosystem is still being built. The installer correctly shows you what's theoretically possible, but many servers aren't published yet.
